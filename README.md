# OLS-Regression-deep-dive
This repository is on diabetics data:
It consists of 10 baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. We have to predict the predefined diabetic metric named as target which is a continuous variable.
